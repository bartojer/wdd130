                    Living in the Rocky Mountain West, the winter season rings in watery skies, bitter breezes that are always in motion, and dormant gardens. This year I was fortunate to participate in a community garden. I tended to a small plot where I grew various dye plants and botanicals to use in dye projects, as well as some “just-for-fun” edibles where I could fit them. That was August. It is now November. Most of the leaves have fallen, gardens have been mulched, now what?

                    I remember my last marigold harvest of the year. However, at the time, I had no idea it would be my last time gathering those vibrant blossoms to then dry in my small 3rd story flat and wait for my next creative project. I was enjoying the growing season so much that the time past me by. The next time I went to harvest I thought to myself, “this will probably be my last cutting of the year – it’s a cold morning.” I arrived to my plot to discover a thick layer of ice coating all of my marigold blossoms and indigo leaves. Goodbye growing season.

                    The days are now shorter. I spend more time indoors than out. Sometimes I feel as though I am hibernating. Lately I have experienced what I would call a creative hibernation or dormancy. Since I am not out growing, harvesting, preserving, or hanging my dye projects to dry in the summer sun – I have stopped creating all together. My mind says, “I’ll wait until the spring to create”. My soul on the other hand is starving of what creating with nature offers: stillness, patience, unity between man and earth.

                    Winter has brought watery grey skies and short days with her, but she also brings new inspiration for my next dye lot!
